  abstract  = {As the gateway to scientific thinking, an understanding of the
               scientific method is essential for success and productivity in
               science. This book is the first synthesis of the practice and
               the philosophy of the scientific method. It will enable
               scientists to be better scientists by offering them a deeper
               understanding of the underpinnings of the scientific method,
               thereby leading to more productive research and experimentation.
               It will also give scientists a more accurate perspective on the
               rationality of the scientific approach and its role in society.
               Beginning with a discussion of today's 'science wars' and
               science's presuppositions, the book then explores deductive and
               inductive logic, probability, statistics, and parsimony, and
               concludes with an examination of science's powers and limits,
               and a look at science education. Topics relevant to a variety of
               disciplines are treated, and clarifying figures, case studies,
               and chapter summaries enhance the pedagogy. This adeptly
               executed, comprehensive, yet pragmatic work yields a new synergy
               suitable for scientists and instructors, and graduate students
               and advanced undergraduates.},

  abstract  = {Modern scientific research has changed so much since Isaac
               Newton's day: it is more professional, collaborative and
               international, with more complicated equipment and a more
               diverse community of researchers. Yet the use of scientific
               journals to report, share and store results is a thread that
               runs through the history of science from Newton's day to ours.
               Scientific journals are now central to academic research and
               careers. Their editorial and peer-review processes act as a
               check on new claims and findings, and researchers build their
               careers on the list of journal articles they have published. The
               journal that reported Newton's optical experiments still exists.
               First published in 1665, and now fully digital, the
               Philosophical Transactions has carried papers by Charles Darwin,
               Dorothy Hodgkin and Stephen Hawking. It is now one of eleven
               journals published by the Royal Society of London. Unrivalled
               insights from the Royal Society's comprehensive archives have
               enabled the authors to investigate more than 350 years of
               scientific journal publishing. The editorial management,
               business practices and financial difficulties of the
               Philosophical Transactions and its sibling Proceedings reveal
               the meaning and purpose of journals in a changing scientific
               community. At a time when we are surrounded by calls to reform
               the academic publishing system, it has never been more urgent
               that we understand its history.},
