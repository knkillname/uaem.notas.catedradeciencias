  abstract  = {As the gateway to scientific thinking, an understanding of the
               scientific method is essential for success and productivity in
               science. This book is the first synthesis of the practice and
               the philosophy of the scientific method. It will enable
               scientists to be better scientists by offering them a deeper
               understanding of the underpinnings of the scientific method,
               thereby leading to more productive research and experimentation.
               It will also give scientists a more accurate perspective on the
               rationality of the scientific approach and its role in society.
               Beginning with a discussion of today's 'science wars' and
               science's presuppositions, the book then explores deductive and
               inductive logic, probability, statistics, and parsimony, and
               concludes with an examination of science's powers and limits,
               and a look at science education. Topics relevant to a variety of
               disciplines are treated, and clarifying figures, case studies,
               and chapter summaries enhance the pedagogy. This adeptly
               executed, comprehensive, yet pragmatic work yields a new synergy
               suitable for scientists and instructors, and graduate students
               and advanced undergraduates.},
